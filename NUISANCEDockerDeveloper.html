      <div>The NUISANCE Docker Developer image is capable of building NUISANCE on a mac or windows machine by using docker to create a lightweight CentOS7 wrapper shell around your current terminal, avoiding possible build conflicts/requirements that can appear when building locally. This requires a build area to be mounted into the docker image at runtime so that changes to the NUISANCE installation persist after the docker image is closed. This has the advantage that NUISANCE comes precompiled so is ready to use out of the box, but it can also be changed and recompiled if required.</div>
      <div><br/></div>
      <div> The nuisance docker developer setup scripts are located on github at the following page :  <a href="https://github.com/NUISANCEMC/docker-devel">Docker Developer</a> </div> 
      <div> Please download the build and setup scripts from there and see the README file for more information on how to set the developer up. </div>
